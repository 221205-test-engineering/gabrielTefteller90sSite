    the internet ain't like it used to be, but one thing has always been the case: cat images and cat gifs are the web's most prolific imports. 
    <br>
    <br>
    there is nothing on the world wide web more ubiquitous than depictions of felines committing preposterous acts.
    <br>
    <br>
    and let's be honest: in the end, the internet isn't really much good for anything else. unless you would like to develop a pornography addiction.
